# Self Evaluation

- **How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?**
I struggled a lot more on this concept than others in general I understand the `for` and how it is used to loop and output code within specified parameters defined but as the code expands and becomes more complex I can easily get lost and need to rely a lot on Googling ideas/ solutions. In terms of vocabulary and broad concepts I am confident with my understanding.

- **This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?**
I did enjoy needing to research more but it is very intimidating not knowing if what I am looking up is the right thing. Luckily with my educational background research is something I am confident doing even if I am not always sure of what to look for. I think this process starts off a little unproductive but as soon as I find what the right phases/ concepts are it quickly shifts into more productive struggle.

- **What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?**
I think I do still have a lot to learn from this day before Mod1. I will continue to practice and research more about `for` statements and keep practicing writing code since this seems to help me best understand the concept. I will be adjusting my calendar to give myself more time for breaks, I feel like I exhausted myself today which led me to work less effectively.

- **What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?**
Again, I think I just need more practice with coding and creating more complex strings so I have a wider understanding of what I am doing. I do still feel confident that I will be able to effectively collaborate with my team/ partner to complete any tasks. If I have any specific questions I will continue to do my own independent research or reach out to my classmates/ teacher.
